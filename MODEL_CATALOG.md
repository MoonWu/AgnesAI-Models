### Text Model Notes

| Model | Current Reference Specs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `agnes-1.5-flash` | `256K` context, `64K` max output reference limit | Recommended for high-throughput chat and low-latency content workflows. |
| `agnes-2.5-flash` | `512K` context, `65.5K` max output reference limit | Fully available to users with Agnes API access. OpenAI-compatible with `agnes-2.0-flash`; use the same base URL, endpoint, message format, streaming, tool calling, and image URL input. Availability, rate limits, and billing depend on account and API key permissions. |
| `agnes-2.0-flash` | `256K` context, `64K` max output reference limit | The temporary `1M` context window was rolled back in June 2026 for stability. Use this model for coding, reasoning, agents, vision input, streaming, and tool calling. |

## Image Models

| Model | Endpoint | Capabilities | Suggested Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agnes-image-2.0-flash` | `POST /v1/images/generations` | Text-to-image, image-to-image, URL output, Base64 output | Creative images, product visuals, posters, image transformation |
| `agnes-image-2.1-flash` | `POST /v1/images/generations` | High-density image generation, image editing, URL or Data URI input, flexible image sizes | Detailed compositions, marketing assets, character visuals, social media content |

## Video Models

| Model | Endpoint | Capabilities | Suggested Use Cases |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `agnes-video-v2.0` | `POST /v1/videos` | Text-to-video, image-to-video, multi-image video, keyframe animation, async generation | Storytelling, marketing videos, product demos, social video, app motion assets |

Video result query:

```text
GET https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/agnesapi?video_id=<VIDEO_ID>
```

Current guidance:

- Use the returned `video_id` to poll video results.
- Do not use `task_id` for current result polling unless a legacy integration specifically documents that workflow.
- If a video task stays queued for more than a few minutes, verify that the polling request is using `video_id`.

Legacy task query format:

```text
GET https://apihub.agnes-ai.com/v1/videos/{task_id}
```

| --- | --- | --- |
| `400` | Invalid request | Required fields, parameter types, image URL accessibility, response format placement, model-specific parameter support. |
| `401` | Authentication failed | API key value, `Authorization: Bearer ...` format, environment variable loading, account status. |
| `404` | Endpoint or resource not found | Base URL, endpoint path, model name, and whether a generated resource ID exists. |
| `429` | Rate limit exceeded | Current user plan, RPM limits, concurrent requests, retry and backoff behavior. |
| `500` | Server error | Retry with backoff, reduce payload complexity, verify whether the issue reproduces with a minimal request. |
| `502` | Upstream gateway error | Retry with backoff and check service status if available. |
| `503` | Service busy or unavailable | Retry later, reduce concurrency, and avoid immediate repeated polling. |
| `520` | Unknown upstream error | Retry with backoff and capture request metadata for support investigation. |
